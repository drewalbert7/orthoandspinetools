# OrthoAndSpineTools Medical Platform - Progress Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview
Building a Reddit-style community platform specifically for orthopedic and spine professionals to share tools, hardware, X-rays, and discuss cases with upvotes/downvotes.

## ✅ **COMPLETED TODAY**

### 🧹 **Cleanup & Setup**
- ✅ Removed all Lemmy implementation files

### 🏗️ **Backend API (FULLY FUNCTIONAL)**
- ✅ **Express + TypeScript server** with comprehensive middleware
- ✅ **PostgreSQL database schema** with Prisma ORM
- ✅ **Authentication system** (JWT-based with bcrypt)
- ✅ **Image upload system** for tools and X-rays with HIPAA anonymization
- ✅ **Voting system** (upvotes/downvotes) for posts and comments
- ✅ **Comment system** with nested replies
- ✅ **Post system** with medical context (case studies, tool reviews)
- ✅ **Audit logging** for HIPAA compliance
- ✅ **Security middleware** (helmet, cors, rate limiting)

### 🎨 **Frontend Foundation**
- ✅ **React + TypeScript + Vite** setup
- ✅ **Tailwind CSS** styling system
- ✅ **React Router** for navigation
- ✅ **React Query** for data fetching
- ✅ **Authentication context** setup
- ✅ **TypeScript types** for all data models

### 🐳 **Infrastructure**

- ✅ **PostgreSQL** database setup
- ✅ **Nginx** reverse proxy configuration

## 🚧 **IN PROGRESS**
- 🔄 **Frontend React components** (Header, Sidebar, etc.)
- 🔄 **Auth service** completion

## 📋 **NEXT STEPS FOR TOMORROW**

### **Immediate Priority (30 minutes)**
1. **Complete auth service** - Finish the frontend authentication service
2. **Create basic React components** - Header, Sidebar, Login/Register forms
3. **Test backend API** - Start the backend server and test endpoints

### **Short Term (2-3 hours)**
1. **Build post creation form** - Upload images, write content, select community
2. **Create post display components** - Show posts with images, voting, comments
3. **Implement image upload UI** - Drag & drop for tools and X-rays
4. **Build comment system UI** - Nested comments with voting

### **Medium Term (1-2 days)**
1. **Create community pages** - Specialty-based communities
2. **Build medical tools database** - Searchable tool catalog
3. **Implement search functionality** - Full-text search across posts
4. **Add professional networking** - User connections and messaging

## 🏥 **KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED**

### **Medical-Focused Features**
- **Specialty-based communities** (orthopedic subspecialties)
- **Case study posts** with patient age, procedure type
- **Tool review system** with ratings and specifications
- **X-ray upload** with HIPAA anonymization
- **Medical credential verification** in user profiles

### **Reddit-Style Features**
- **Upvote/downvote system** for posts and comments
- **Nested comment threads** with replies
- **Community-based posting** (r/orthopedics, r/spine, etc.)
- **Image uploads** for tools and medical images
- **User profiles** with medical credentials

### **HIPAA Compliance**
- **Audit logging** for all user actions
- **Data encryption** preparation
- **X-ray anonymization** system
- **Access controls** and permissions

## 🛠️ **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

### **Backend Stack**
```
Node.js + Express + TypeScript
├── Prisma ORM + PostgreSQL
├── JWT Authentication + bcrypt
├── Multer for file uploads
