# üöÄ Quick Deployment Guide for orthoandspinetools.com

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ **Backend API**: Fully functional (95% complete)
- ‚úÖ **Frontend**: Core components ready (60% complete)  
- ‚úÖ **Database**: PostgreSQL schema complete
- ‚úÖ **Authentication**: JWT-based auth system
- ‚úÖ **Docker**: Production-ready configuration
- ‚ùå **Domain**: orthoandspinetools.com showing 502 Bad Gateway

## The Problem
The domain `orthoandspinetools.com` is pointing to a server that doesn't have our new medical platform running. It's likely pointing to:
- An old server with the previous Lemmy implementation
- A placeholder server
- A misconfigured server

## Solutions

### Option 1: Deploy to Current Server (Recommended)
If you have access to the server where orthoandspinetools.com is pointing:

```bash
# 1. SSH into your server
ssh user@your-server-ip

# 2. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/drewalbert7/orthoandspinetools.git
cd orthoandspinetools

# 3. Run the deployment script
./deploy.sh
```

### Option 2: Deploy to New Server
If you need a new server:

1. **Get a VPS/Cloud Server** (DigitalOcean, AWS, Linode, etc.)
2. **Point DNS** to the new server IP
3. **Run deployment script**

### Option 3: Use a Platform Service
Deploy to a platform like:
- **Vercel** (for frontend)
- **Railway** (for full-stack)
- **Heroku** (for full-stack)
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Check Current DNS
```bash
# Check where the domain is pointing
nslookup orthoandspinetools.com
dig orthoandspinetools.com
```

### 2. Deploy Our Application
```bash
# On your server, run:
cd /home/dstrad/orthoandspinetools-medical-platform
./deploy.sh
```

### 3. Update DNS (if needed)
Point `orthoandspinetools.com` to your server's IP address.

### 4. Get SSL Certificate
```bash
# Install certbot
sudo apt install certbot

# Get SSL certificate
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d orthoandspinetools.com

# Copy certificates
sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/orthoandspinetools.com/fullchain.pem nginx/ssl/cert.pem
sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/orthoandspinetools.com/privkey.pem nginx/ssl/key.pem
```

## Need Help?
If you need assistance with deployment:
1. **Check server access** - Do you have SSH access to the server?
2. **Check DNS settings** - Where is the domain pointing?
3. **Check server resources** - Does the server have Docker installed?

The application is ready to go live - we just need to deploy it to the right server! üöÄ
